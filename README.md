- 👋 Hi, I’m @ragmoh, and based in London, UK. I am IT graduate working on web apps. I have in the past, working as a full stack PHP developer,
- and built web applications using PHP and MySQL DB. Now I focus mainly on Backend development. I do front-end too sometimes.
- 👀 I’m interested in Backend Development using Python and Flask with DB connectivity. I also develop Restful API with Flask and occasionally with Bottle.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a web app which is technically challenging. It has huge security side to it.
- 💞️ If there is somebody who likes a challenge, and want to collaborate, get in touch 
- 📫 How to reach me is by email techman444@gmail.com
